FragilityCurves
===============
The toolbox FragilityCurves is aimed at providing civil engineers a quick access to seismic risk assessment.
Given a set of data (Intensity measure vs. Engineering demand parameter), the toolbox will allow one to obtain the fragility curves by different means. It can also be used in similar context when one needs to compute the failure probability (or probability of exceeding a prescribed threshold) conditioned on a given measure.

If you use the toolbox, you are supposed to cite the following paper of the author.
